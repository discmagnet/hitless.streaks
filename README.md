# hitless.streaks

The easiest way for me to come up with baseball research ideas is by thinking of ways I can apply baseball examples to the new methods I learn. That's how I came up with my Enhanced Quality Start idea, and thatâ€™s how I came up with the following idea. Survival analysis is my favorite area of statistics, and I've been looking at how to analyze recurrent events. It was actually pretty hard for me to come up with a baseball example for this one. But eventually, I thought about hitting streaks and instead of thinking in terms of time, it would be easier to think in terms of at bats or plate appearances. From there, I wondered if it would be more interesting to look at hitless streaks.

At what point does a hitless streak get into the head of the batter? If hitless streaks didn't factor into a batter's ability to get a hit, we would expect a player's BA to be independent of the number of at-bats since the last hit. I would hypothesize that after about a dozen at bats without a hit, there is a drop in the player's BA. The one thing I need to be careful of is that I may only be capturing the hitters with worse hitting ability when I get further down that line. It may be useful to do a simulation to see that similar trend. So how do we get around this bias we see in the change in BA? This is where I think using survival analysis with recurrent events will come into play.
